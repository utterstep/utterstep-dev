Last three days I'm in Berlin, visiting my sister. This have taken a lot of my time and energy,
so I'm not writing much. But I want to keep the daily streak going, so here's a short note.

## 50 years of tax cuts for the rich failed to trickle down, economics study says

Thanks to [King Kaufman](https://sfba.social/@kingkaufman/113334090277614932) for this link:
https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tax-cuts-rich-50-years-no-trickle-down/.
The title is pretty self-explanatory, I just hope that more people will start to see that
tax cuts for the rich are beneficial only for the rich themselves.

And I'm saying this as someone who is on average in the top ~1% of the income distribution
in the world, so I would benefit from the tax cuts myself. I just don't think that this short-term
benefit is worth the long-term damage of extracting excessive wealth from the economy.

## Laziness death spirals

A great post from
[Patrick D. Farley](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/patrickdfarley?from=post_header)
on how laziness can also compound and spiral out of control in the same way as hard work can.

It's pretty subjective, but I see his experience as very close to mine.

_In some way, the fact that I'm writing this post right now is in a small part due to his post._

## Not remotely cool: The science of “Zoom fatigue”

[Research paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451958821000671)
from the University of Gothenburg, together with the Stanford University, regarding the Zoom
fatigue. Nothing groundbreaking, but matches my experience pretty well.
