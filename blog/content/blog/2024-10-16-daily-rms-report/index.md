Life is not all roses and rainbows, so today – a link to the
[Stallman Report](https://stallman-report.org/). Yeas, the same
[Stallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) who is the founder of the
[Free Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org/) and the [GNU Project](https://www.gnu.org/).

Even though we don't see there the worst of the worst, it's still a pretty damning report,
detailing the history of Stallman's abuse, victim blaming, gymnastics to excuse child abuse (!),
and so on.

What's worse, it's not something unique to Stallman – in my experience, I can replace his name with
several others and the report would be 90+% accurate, save for the direct quotes and RMS's
particular fixation on defending child abuse.

It's a grim reminder that tech is still a very toxic and unsafe place for many people.
And that we are waaaay to easy to turn a blind eye to the abuse, as long as the abuser
is someone prominent and can be excused by combination of "genius" and "weirdness".

Please, remember – sexual harassment isn't a quirk, it's a crime. Victim blaming isn't a quirk,
it's a way to enable abusers.

And no, [14-year-olds](https://stallman-report.org/on-children/) still can't consent, dammit!
