## Preface

Long I've been thinking about collecting and sharing things that I find interesting.

I've been doing this in various forms for years, but never in a consistent way – 
I tried Telegram channels and saved notes, I made a few thematic blogs, but nothing stuck.

I think the main reason why it floped each time was that I was trying to perform for
an audience more than for myself. And then it got boring, and I stopped.

Now I'll try a different approach:
I'll just write a short note every day about something that caught my eye.

I'll try to keep it short and sweet, and I'll try to do it every day.

Let's see how it goes.

## From Tom Scott

Another week, another great [newsletter](https://www.tomscott.com/newsletter/) from Tom Scott.

Somehow today I was fascinated by the things rock-themed:
- The amazing [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60T9TKuuujs),
  accompanying the new paper on how climate change resulted in mountain peak falling in Greenland,
  which in turn caused 9-day long vibrations in the Earth's crust.
- The [list of individual rocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_individual_rocks)
  on Wikipedia. I mean, _the list of individual rocks_.

## Europa Clipper Trajectory

[Short series of toots](https://mathstodon.xyz/@johncarlosbaez/113312318069599634) on the
trajectory of the recently launched [Europa Clipper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_Clipper)
mission.

Long story short: I would expect that the trajectory would be complicated in the beginning,
to get the spacecraft to Jupiter using all the gravity assists available, but then it would
be a simple elliptical orbit around Europa.

Turns out, it's not that simple due to the _radiation environment around Jupiter_.
Putting it simply, the Jupiter radiation would fry the spacecraft too fast for it to be useful.
