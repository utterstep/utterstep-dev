I'll just quote [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/13/cabel-xoxo):

> The less you know about this talk, the more you’ll enjoy watching it unfold.
> Just remarkably good. Trust me, watch it now, before anything about it is spoiled for you.

Already spoiled a bit in the title, so don't risk further and just watch it :)
