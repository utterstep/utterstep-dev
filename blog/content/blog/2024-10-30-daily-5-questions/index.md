This Saturday there was an election here in Georgia, next Tuesday there will be one in the US.

Just the time for a quote like that, found [here](https://elk.zone/infosec.exchange/@davep/113387878544027464):

> Tony Benn said those in positions of economic, social and political power should always be asked five questions:
> * “What power have you got?”
> * “Where did you get it from?”
> * “In whose interests do you use it?”
> * “To whom are you accountable?”
> * _“How do we get rid of you?”_
