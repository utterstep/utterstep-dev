I'm still in the progresss of reading the
[Coreboot drama](https://www.malibal.com/features/dont-support-the-coreboot-project/),
but it's facinating enought to share it already.

Long story short, it's a story of a company that tried to use
[Coreboot](https://www.coreboot.org/) (an open-source firmware for laptops, that is supposed to
replace the proprietary BIOS/UEFI) in their laptops, but then had a god-awful experience with the
different members of the Coreboot community, from consultants to the project leadership.

One thing that struck me is how you can be a complete asshole and still be in the tech industry
([again](@/blog/2024-10-16-daily-rms-report/index.md)).
I mean, I know that it's not a meritocracy, but still, how these people get a job?

Just one quote from the article:

> A lot of Christian’s emails looked like they were written by a 12-year-old on their phone.
> He didn’t capitalize the first letter of a lot of sentences, had obvious typos, and improper
> punctuation. He also had the habit of talking down to us, repeatedly trying to
> “put us in our place” and “set us straight” when we were just trying to get help
> debugging our code. I guess this is the level of service you get for $300 an hour in Germany.

I'm also surprised to see that these issues justified to Malibal the decision to
[forever ban selling all their laptops to Germany](https://portal.malibal.com/kb/a1060/why-dont-you-ship-to-germany/),
it seems to me like an overreaction.

But I'm not in the business of selling laptops, so what do I know?

## Update from October 21st

Okay, finished reading this article I now assess it as the usual "looks like no one is right here".

I don't think that the authors from MALIBAL are inventing the facts – I saw a lot of
hard-to-stomach engineers in my life. But from this whole article it seems that MALIBAL themselves
are more than a bit overemotional and hence and tend to see the problem in anyone but themselves.
